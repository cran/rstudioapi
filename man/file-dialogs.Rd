should begin browsing. When \code{NULL}, defaults to the current RStudio

with a particular extension. For example, to scope the dialog to
\R files, one could use \code{R Files (*.R)} here.}

}
\description{
Prompt the user for the path to a file or folder, using the system
file dialogs with RStudio Desktop, and RStudio's own web dialogs
with RStudio Server.
}
\details{
When the selected file resolves within the user's home directory,
RStudio will return an aliased path -- that is, prefixed with \code{~/}.
}
\note{
The \code{selectFile} and \code{selectDirectory} functions were
  added in version 1.1.287 of RStudio.
