\description{
Translates a local URL into an externally accessible URL on RStudio Server.
}
\details{
On RStudio Server, URLs which refer to the local host network address (such
as \code{http://localhost:1234/} and \code{http://127.0.0.1:5678/}) must be
translated in order to be externally accessible from a browser. This method
performs the required translation, and returns the translated URL, which
RStudio Server uses to proxy HTTP requests.

Returns an unmodified URL on RStudio Desktop, and when the URL does not refer
to a local address.
