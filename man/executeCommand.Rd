\usage{
executeCommand(commandId, quiet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{commandId}{The ID of the command to execute.}

\item{quiet}{Whether to show an error if the command does not exist.}
}
\description{
Executes an arbitrary RStudio command.
}
\details{
Most menu commands and many buttons in RStudio can be invoked from the API
using this method.

The \code{quiet} command governs the behavior of the function when the
command does not exist. By default, an error is shown if you attempt to
invoke a non-existent command. You should set this to \code{TRUE} when invoking
a command that may not be available if you don't want your users to see an
error.

The command is run asynchronously, so no status is returned.

See the RStudio Server Professional Administration Guide appendix for a list
of supported command IDs.
}
\note{
The \code{executeCommand} function was introduced in RStudio 1.2.1261.
